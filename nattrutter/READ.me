raw material is nattrutt_4326_coords.csv, created from NattPOSITIONSMASTER.xls
(this one is correct, in the original one site had 21 points which meant that iterating every 20 points created some erroneous sites)

run nattrutt_convert_sites.py to convert nattrutt_4326_coords.csv to nattrutter_upload.json which can be injected into mongo db
for site extent it calculates the centroid of the 20 points that are in transectParts

to inject to mongo:
mongoimport --jsonArray --db ecodata --collection site --file natrutter_upload.json
